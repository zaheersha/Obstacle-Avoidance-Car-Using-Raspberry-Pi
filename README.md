# Obstacle-Avoidance-Car-Using-Raspberry-Pi
Robots are machines which reduce the human efforts in heavy works by automating the tasks in industries, factories, hospitals etc. Most of the car are run by using some control unit or components like a push button, remote, joystick, PC, gestures and by executing some command by using controller or processor. But today we are here with a Automatic car which moves autonomously without any external events avoiding all the obstacle in its path, yes we talking about Obstacle Avoiding Car. In this project, we have used Raspberry Pi and Motor driver to drive the Car and Ultrasonic sensor for detecting objects in the path of car.
